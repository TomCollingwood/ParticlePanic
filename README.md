# ParticlePanic
A 2D physics engine which can simulate fluid-like particles.
The first aim of this project is to simulate fluid-like behavior with point-like circle particles.
Then as I move on I will implement a nice visual style involving marching squares.
A stretch goal would be to implement rigid bodies made up of a group of particles.
