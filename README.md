# ParticlePanic
A 2D physics engine which can simulate fluid-like particles.
The first aim of this project is to simulate fluid-like behavior with point-like circle particles.
Then as I move on I will implement a nice visual style involving marching squares.
A stretch goal would be to implement rigid bodies made up of a group of particles. 

HOW TO USE----------------
The icons at the top are as follows:
(1) Water: click this to be able to draw water by click and dragging in window below icons.
(2) Erase: click this to be able to erase particles by left clicking and dragging
(3) Hand: click this to be able to drag clumps of particles around
(4) Tap: click this to turn on/off the tap.
(5) Gravity: click this to turn on/off gravity.
(6) Rubbish: click this to clear the world of all particles.
(7) Help: (To be implemented - watch this space)

There are also keyboard shortcuts:
'w' : able to draw walls
'r' : change the render option
'g' : turn gravity on/off
'0' : tap gives water
'1' : tap gives random type of particle*
'p' : 3D mode! Clicking and dragging in this mode rotates the camera.
'o' : 2D mode.

*This type of particle is randomized every time you press '1'. Including all instanced particles of this type.
